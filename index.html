	   On our trip to Archer Malmo, I, along with others, got to experience and hear how it is to work for a designing company. Our "tour guide", Mr. Gabe, gave us the overall gist of how the company runs. He explained to us things the workers have to do there, including projects, building websites for companies, and even having there only fun designing different gadgets such as an appliance that keeps score while they play ping pong.

	   	The environment there and set up catches your attention as soon as you walk in starting with their gold elevators. We went up to the fifth floor, where he spoke to us about his job. He let us know that they are pet friendly, and very lenient as long as you get your work done. Therefore, if you happen to show up late, or have to miss a few days, it won't count against you. He informed us that you don't need to be a college graduate to get hired there, and that they do internships. He showed us some projects he worked on and explained to us that when they are doing a project for a client, they send them a sketch of it first: which I didn’t know.

		Although I find interest topic of computers and technology, I don't believe it will be in any interest of mine in the future: but who knows. We got to visit a green room where they have photoshoots and make animations. I found that interesting and wouldn’t mind seeing the process that goes behind that.

		Archer Malmo is a pet friendly environment, so you can have your pet with you while on the job.  It makes your job extra relaxing and fun when your little friend a is with you bouncing around in your office. After we left, we ate at cookout. There were about 50 of us all going in. Luckily, the service was fast so I got my order quickly. I ordered a bacon cheeseburger, chicken nuggets, and a chicken cheese quesadilla. All of us were full on our way back to school. I went to seventh period study hall and when I sat down, everybody was asking me about the field trip. I told them it was fun and memorable. I told them a couple of us even got to play ping pong.
